### __Introduction__ ###

#### Purpose ####
A typical solar panel converts only 30 to 40 percent of the incident solar irradiation into electrical
energy. Thus to get a constant output, an automated system is required which should be capable to
constantly rotate the solar panel. The Sun Tracking System (STS) was made as a prototype to solve the
problem, mentioned above. It is completely automatic and keeps the panel in front of sun until that is
visible. The unique feature of this system is that instead of taking the earth as its reference, it takes the
sun as a guiding source. Its active sensors constantly monitor the sunlight and rotate the panel towards
the direction where the intensity of sunlight is maximum. With the rapid increase in population and
economic development, the problems of the energy crisis and global warming effects are today a
cause for increasing concern. The utilization of renewable OPEN ACCESS Sensors 2013, 13 3158
energy resources is the key solution to these problems. Solar energy is one of the primary sources of
clean, abundant and inexhaustible energy, that not only provides alternative energy resources, but
also improves environmental pollution. The most immediate and technologically attractive use of
solar energy is through photovoltaic conversion. The physics of the PV cell (also called solar cell) is
very similar to the classical p-n junction diode. The PV cell converts the sunlight directly into direct
current (DC) electricity by the photovoltaic effect. A PV panel or module is a packaged
interconnected assembly of PV cells. In order to maximize the power output from the PV panels, one
needs to keep the panels in an optimum position perpendicular to the solar radiation during the day.
As such, it is necessary to have it equipped with a Sun tracker. Compared to a fixed panel, a mobile
PV panel driven by a Sun tracker may boost consistently the energy gain of the PV panel

#### Scope ####
* It can be used for small and medium scale power generations.
* It can be used for power generation at remote places where power lines are not accessible.
* It can be used for domestic and industrial power backup sytem.
* Solar radiation Tracker has played a vital role in increasing the efficiency of solar 
panels in recent years, thus proving to be a better technological achievement. The
vital importance of a dual axis solar tracker lies in its better efficiency and
sustainability to give a better output compared to a fived solar panel or a single axis
solar tracker. The tracking system is designed such that it can trap the solar energy in
all possible directions
